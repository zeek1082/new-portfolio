### What was the ask of the project?

AutoGravity worked with a consulting agency to design a prototype for a Proof of Concept. When I came on board, they were looking to improve designs for the initial launch. In addition to improving designs for current functionality, they also wanted to add functionality such as leasing, account management, and improving the credit application flow.
